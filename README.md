## Overview of Election Audit
Tom has asked us to assist in an election audit of the tabulated results for U.S Congressional precinct in Colorado. I have been asked to report the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote. By using Python we will be able to automate the process. We will be taking a look at the three primary voting methods mail-in ballots, punch cards, and direct recording electronic. I had to generate a vote count report to certify this U.S. congressional race.
I will need to write a Python Script to find:
* Total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes 
* Total number of votes each candidate received 
* Percentage of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote
* The voter turnout for each county
* The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
* The county with the highest turnout
* The voter turnout for each county
* The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
* The county with the highest turnout
